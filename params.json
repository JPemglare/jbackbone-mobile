{"name":"Jbackbone-mobile","body":"jbackbone-mobile\r\n================\r\n\r\nMobile Web App Framework for easy building Mobile Navigation Structures -> Just using native Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3.\r\nWorking perfectly on iOS and Android devices.\r\n\r\n**Sample demo running here: [RUNNING DEMO](http://lab.ochio.com.es/sample/index.html).**\r\n\r\nMain concepts:\r\n-------------\r\nSo, A PAGE:\r\n- It should have a main DIV with a unique ID (i.e : 'sample-page').\r\n- As it is a PAGE referenced from Menu it must have JUST the 'block' class.\r\n- As it is a PAGE it should contains a \"Menu button\" in its header.\r\n- A page always has a 'section' where it contains the page content.\r\n- A page could contain one (or more) link(s) to PAGES or SUBPAGES.\r\n\r\nThen, A SUB-PAGE:\r\n- It should have a main DIV with a unique ID (i.e : 'sample-subpage').\t\r\n- As it is a SUBPAGE referenced from another PAGE, it must have BOTH the 'block' and 'sub-block' classes.\r\n- As it is a SUBPAGEPAGE it should contain a \"Back button\" in its header.\r\n- A subpage always has a 'section' where it contains the subpage content.\r\n- A subpage could contains one (or more) link(s) to PAGES or SUBAPGES.\r\n\r\nOther concepts:\r\n---------------\r\nThere are several reserved IDs and wouldn't be reused. The most important are:\r\n\r\n- 'index', this ID identifies first page to be loaded at start (see sample-page1.html).\r\n- 'menu-page', this ID identifies the main menu page, noramlly located on the left side of your application.\r\n- 'slider' and 'binder', these two IDs are used for the JS library for animation and sliding porpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods you may know:\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\n- jbackbone.goToPage('whatever page ID you want to go')  --> This method takes you the page you want to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n- jbackbone.goToPage('whatever page ID you want to go',{animate:false,resetHistory:true}) --> It is the same us the one before but this one is normally used in links in the menu-page. When you navigate from a page to another of your application the library keeps a history of your pages visited. When you start click from the menu is useful to reset your navigation history. (See sampple-menu.html). \r\n\r\n- jbackbone.toggleMenu(); --> Method used for toggle the menu page whenever is clicked the menu button.\r\n\r\n- jbackbone.goBack(); --> Method used for go back on your navigation history when you click on back button on a deeper page.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO USE IT\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n1.- Create an index.html page using the \"index.html\" sample code provided. Notice how to link the javascript library into the header section.\r\n\r\n2.- Add a javascript code in your header as this one, where to indicate which pages build your application.\r\n\r\n\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n\t\tdocument.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", function () {\r\n\r\n\t\t\t/**\r\n\t\t\t IMPORTANT!!!!!\r\n\t\t\t 1.
