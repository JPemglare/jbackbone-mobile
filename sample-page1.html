<!-- 
Main concepts:

+ PAGES: one 'page' it is always linked from the Menu as an achor using its ID.
+ SUB-PAGES, Level 1: one 'subpage level 1' could be linked from another PAGE using its ID, NEVER from the Menu.
+ SUB-PAGES, Level 2: one 'subpage level 2' is always linked from another SUB-PAGE Level 1.
...
+ SUB-PAGES, Level N: one 'subpage level N' is always linked from another SUB-PAGE Level (N-1).



So, A PAGE:
	- It should have a main DIV with a unique ID (i.e : 'sample-page').
	- As it is a PAGE referenced from Menu it must have JUST the 'block' class.
	- As it is a PAGE it should contains a "menu button" in its header.
	- A page always has a 'section' where it contains the page content.
	- A page could contains one (or more) Link to another SUBPAGE, then this SUBPAGE would be a supage level 1.

Then, A SUB-PAGE:
	- It should have a main DIV with a unique ID (i.e : 'sample-subpage').	
	- As it is a SUBPAGE referenced from another PAGE it must have BOTH the 'block' and 'sub-block' classes.
	- As it is a SUBPAGEPAGE it should contains a "back button" in its header.
	- A subpage always has a 'section' where it contains the subpage content.
	- A subpage could contains one (or more) Link(s) to another new SUB-PAGE, then this new SUB-PAGE would be a supage one level deeper.
